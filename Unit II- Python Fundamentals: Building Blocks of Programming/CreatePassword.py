# \d â†’ Ensures the password has at least one numeric digit.
# [^A-Za-z0-9] â†’ Ensures the password has at least one special character.
# Combined all conditions using and to ensure all are met.
# Retained print(dir(password)) if you want to see available string methods (not necessary for password validation).
